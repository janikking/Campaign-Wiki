<p><em>One of the smallest, most remote villages of the Kingdom of Aendonia. Located between the Crying Cliffs and Aenden’s Domain, the weather is not the most favourable nor is the fertility of the soil. The reason people first started gathering around the area and why it is still a profitable location is due to the proximity to the bountiful gemstone veins under the mountain</em></p>
