<p>_A decently sized town located central in Aendonia, on the four way crossing to the central roads of the kingdom. It’s is a heavily agricultural-focused town, being the main producer of grains and wheats for the rest of the kingdom and then some. Those not into growing crops will likely find themselves in the business of brewing ales or distilling liquors. _</p>
