Ross Marley

Born on a merchant ship traveling [The Splattered Sea](The%20Splattered%20Sea.md), Ross Marley has always been fascinated by the wilderness of nature. He’s never met his biological parents as he had to be abandoned at birth. Their village, hidden somewhere in the forgotten forest, was being attacked while [his mother](Ross%20Birthmother.md) was giving birth. The last remaining firbolg had decided to use their ability to disguise themselves and step into the shadows to escape into the hidden forest. The newborn firbolg was put to sleep by [his father](Ross%20Birthfather.md) while his mother carried him. Although the mother had been lagging behind a bit due to her exhaustion, all was going according to plan.

Until suddenly the newborn firbolg woke up and alerted some of the [raiders](Corps%20of%20Chains.md). Arrows went flying towards the sound and the little firbolg and his mother were separated from the rest of the group, fleeing through [The Forgotten Forest](The%20Forgotten%20Forest.md). Two raiders were following them and the mother knew they would both die if she just ran with the newborn’s weight slowing her down. So she hid the little firbolg in a hollow part at the trunk of a tree, and led the raiders away from him. This was the last time Ross Marley had seen his biological mother.           

The one who Ross Marley called mother, was a dwarf named[ Marros Donkeg](%20Marros%20Donkeg). Marros was short even for a dwarf, but she was feisty nonetheless. She was the captain of a large merchant sailboat, [The Crown Prize](The%20Crown%20Prize.md). Which circled the many seas for trade with the various ports of Fa’eldar. One time while the ship was anchored in [Al'ta Taras](Al'ta%20Taras.md), she had found a little firbolg floating down the river.

With the help of a sailor, they fished him out of the water, dried him, fed him and gave him a warm place to sleep for the night. The following morning, Marros set out to look for the firbolg’s parents, together with her husband [Quoros Bronzebottom](Quoros%20Bronzebottom.md), A gnome trader she met on the ship. This turned out to be a waste of effort though, since the little firbolg had no interest in anything other than his warm place to sleep on the ship. When the ship departed, they had decided to officially adopt the firbolg and name him Ross Marley. They never quite knew what age Ross Marley was at the time of the adoption, but given his size at the time they thought he could have been been anywhere from 2 to 3 years old already.

Ross grew up in a very dynamic environment, learning to barter from watching his dad do his trades
