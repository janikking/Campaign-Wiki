- ### Short Summary
	Party started around 4PM, just battled Nicholas and his lads and killed them. Aramis put them all up hanging from the trees. After a short rest, they headed for the mines with Ross disguised as Nicholas. Once they arrived, the guards fetched Michelle who immediately saw through the disguise and commenced the battle. It was hard fought, multiple members going down at some point, but they persevered and were victorious. After springing a trapped chest in the office, allowing catuli to go down, they found a bunch of gems and gold, a couple of potions, and two documents showing a number of mining tunnels and proof of someone keeping Eastfall in the shadows in exchange for gems.
