_Aenden is the capital city of the Kingdom of Aendonia. It is the only populated place in the kingdom where the disparate state of the country is not as apparent. Still lively and busy, Aenden is home to gamblers and drunkards embracing their vices, artisans and craftmen perfecting their trade, researchers absorbed in their studies and the rich and those in power clinging to their station._
