| Occupation | Planned on living his old years in the mine, retiring from travelling. Now thieving in the mine                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Locations  | Born in Dethodrum, travelled around and now kind of stuck in the mine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Appearance | Old, wrinkly yet strong looking rock dwarf. Long unkept grey hair and beard reaching to his bellybutton, weary but alert blue eyes. Scars across his face with part of his left ear missing. Not very bulky. Wearing grey and green robes, covering leather armour and a thick adorned belt off of which hang two shortswords |
| Bonds      | Domar is his closest buddy right now in the mines. After that is Torman Hardswing but he hasnt seen her in a couple years. Beside that has some family in Dethodurn.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Motivation | His peaceful hardworking retirement has been interrupted with nothing he could do about it. A chance to escape the mines has finally come.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Flaws      | Can become too passionate thus blinding his sight. Easily convinced by others                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Assets     | Not a lot, some beaten up armour and clothes, some gems and chisels, two shortswords and a Belt of Dwarvenkind                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
